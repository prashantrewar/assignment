# Problem Statement: Explain the code snippet


```
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    cnp := make(chan func(), 10)
    for i := 0; i < 4; i++ {
        go func() {
            for f := range cnp {
                f()
            }
        }()
    }
    cnp <- func() {
        fmt.Println("HERE1")
    }
    fmt.Println("Hello")
}

```

## 1. Explaining how the highlighted constructs work?

```
cnp := make(chan func(), 10)
    for i := 0; i < 4; i++ {
        go func() {
            for f := range cnp {
                f()
            }
        }()
    }
cnp <- func() {
    fmt.Println("HERE1")
}

```

The make(chan func(), 10) creates a buffered channel with a capacity of 10 means the channel can hold up to 10 function references before sending blocks. After that we run a for loop which iterates 4 times and in each iteration we run a goroutine (using the go keyword) which reads values (in this case, a function) from the buffer channel and executes the function.In the end we are inserting a function that prins HERE1 into the buffer channel.



## 2. Use-cases of these constructs

Channels: Used for communication between concurrent goroutines, ensuring safe data exchange without explicit locking mechanisms.

Goroutines: Ideal for performing tasks concurrently, such as handling multiple client requests, processing data in parallel, etc.


## 3. Significance of the for loop with 4 iterations

```
for i := 0; i < 4; i++ {
    go func() {
        for f := range cnp {
            f()
        }
    }()
}

```

This loop starts 4 goroutines. Each goroutine continuously reads from the cnp channel and executes the functions received from the channel. The use of 4 iterations means there are 4 concurrent workers ready to process functions sent to the channel. This pattern can be used to create a worker pool, which can efficiently handle multiple tasks in parallel.


## 4. Significance of make(chan func(), 10)

```
cnp := make(chan func(), 10)

```

Creating a buffered channel with a capacity of 10 means the channel can hold up to 10 function references before sending blocks. This is useful to ensure that the sending goroutine is not blocked until one of the worker goroutines starts consuming from the channel. It provides a buffer to accommodate bursts of tasks.

## 5. Why is “HERE1” not getting printed?

```
cnp <- func() {
    fmt.Println("HERE1")
}
fmt.Println("Hello")

```

"HERE1" is not getting printed because the program terminates before the goroutine has a chance to execute the function from the channel. Here’s the sequence of events:

   Main goroutine starts and creates the channel and worker goroutines.
   Main goroutine sends a function that prints "HERE1" to the channel.
   Main goroutine immediately prints "Hello" and then exits.
   When the main goroutine exits, the program terminates, killing all other goroutines. The worker goroutines might not get a chance to read and execute the function from the channel before the main goroutine exits. This is why the output is not deteminss and HERE1 might or might not get printed.
